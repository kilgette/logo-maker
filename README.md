Objective: Build a Node.js command-line app that takes in user input to generate a logo
and save it as an SVG file based on the user's color, shape and logo text inputs. 


What I Learned: I learned a great deal about how to incorporate Jest to run unit tests, and Inquirer for
collecting input as well as practice utilizing render methods and outputs. I look forward to building more
Node.js projects in the near future.
